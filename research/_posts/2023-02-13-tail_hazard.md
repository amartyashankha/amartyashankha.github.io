Understanding the shape of a distribution of data is of interest to people in a great variety of fields, as it may affect the types of algorithms used for that data. Given samples from a distribution, we seek to understand how many elements appear infrequently, that is, to characterize the tail of the distribution. We develop an algorithm based on a careful bucketing scheme that distinguishes light-tailed distributions from non-light-tailed ones via a definition based on the hazard rate under some natural smoothness and ordering assumptions. We verify our theoretical results empirically.
