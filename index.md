These days I'm at a startup, teaching the machine gods to become themselves. Sometimes it works.
A departure from proving theorems; still lots of coffee, papers, and staring at screens.

In a past life, I did a PhD in theoretical computer science with [Prof. Ronitt Rubinfeld](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/), mostly on graphs and sublinear-time algorithms. I also picked up my other two degrees at the 'tute and eventually had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, out the door.

When I'm not staring at a screen, I snowboard, tinker with random hardware projects, fold paper into improbable shapes, and play various kinds of sportsball with more enthusiasm than talent.
