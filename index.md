My name is Amartya Shankha Biswas, but most people call me Shankha.
I grew up in the university campus of [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in India.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science in [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/),
under the supervision of the wonderful [Prof. Ronitt Rubinfeld](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/).
I also received my Bachelor's and Master's degree from MIT in 2018.

My interests broadly lie in the realm of sub-linear time algorithms, parallel/distributed models of computation,
and algorithmic graph theory.
I have also dabbled in computational origami and folding problems.
