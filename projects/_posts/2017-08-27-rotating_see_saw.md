Rebecca and I designed and built a rotating see-saw for East Campus Rush 2017.
This ride was unsuccessfully attempted in previous years, but failed due to various construction issues.
This year, we redesigned the ride using the base of [#YOLO](../2016-09-01-YOLO/) as a starting point for the rotation axis.
